## ðŸ§  **AI Decision-Making Architecture**

### **1. Natural Language Processing**
- **Query Analysis**: Uses keyword matching and pattern recognition
- **Intent Detection**: Identifies user goals (sustainability, profit, risk, comparison)
- **Context Understanding**: Handles variations in phrasing and terminology

### **2. Multi-Factor Scoring Algorithm**
```python
# Example: Long-term investment scoring
score = sustainability_score
if market_cap == 'high': score += 3
if market_cap == 'medium': score += 1
# AI ranks options by composite score
```

### **3. Decision Trees**
- **Sustainability Focus**: Prioritizes eco-friendly options
- **Profitability Focus**: Emphasizes rising trends and market cap
- **Risk Assessment**: Balances potential returns with stability
- **Comparative Analysis**: Multi-dimensional evaluation

### **4. Personalized Recommendations**
- Adapts responses based on user intent
- Provides reasoning for each recommendation
- Includes risk warnings and disclaimers
